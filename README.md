# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Since the launch of Kaia Blockchain this repository has been parked in favour of the new open-source projects in [Kaia's Github](https://github.com/kaiachain). Contributors have now moved there continuing with massive open-source contributions to our blockchain ecosystem. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed to this repository. For more information about Klaytn's chain merge with Finschia blockchain please refer to the launching of Kaia blockchain - [kaia.io](http://kaia.io/).

# klaytn-subgraphs
Subgraphs extracts data from a blockchain, process it and store it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL.

We implemented mappings for the integrated core module smart-contracts, based on this, we created the following subgraphs:

- Pair 
- Blocks
- Staking 
- Farming 
- Exchange 

All the above subgraphs are available through the GraphQL API. All thetransactions, history of operations & token price information is retrieved from these subgraphs.
