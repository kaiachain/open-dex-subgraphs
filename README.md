# klaytn-subgraphs
Subgraphs extracts data from a blockchain, process it and store it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL.

We implemented mappings for the integrated core module smart-contracts, based on this, we created the following subgraphs:

- Pair 
- Blocks
- Staking 
- Farming 
- Exchange 

All the above subgraphs are available through the GraphQL API. All thetransactions, history of operations & token price information is retrieved from these subgraphs.
